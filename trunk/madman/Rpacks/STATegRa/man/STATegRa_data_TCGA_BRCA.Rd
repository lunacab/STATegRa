\description{
Data were downloaded from TCGA data portal, \url{https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/}.
We downloaded sixteen tumour samples and the sixteen matching normal, for Breast invasive carcinoma, BRCA, batch 93.
Herein, three types of data modalities are included, RNAseq (\code{TCGA_BRCA_Data$RNAseq}), RNAseqV2 (\code{TCGA_BRCA_Data$RNAseqV2})
and Expression-Genes (\code{TCGA_BRCA_Data$Microarray}). The “Data Level” was set to Level 3.
More information about these types of data as well as the "data level" can be found \url{https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDataType.jsp}
For each data type, we pooled all data to one matrix, where rows corresponded to genes and columns to samples.
Then, columns and rows were aligned across matrices so as each gene and each sample to correspond to the same position.
Here only the first 100 genes are included.
